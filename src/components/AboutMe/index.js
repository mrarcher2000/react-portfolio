                <p>Hello! My name is Archer Nicholson and I am a 20 year old Full-Stak Web Developer located in Phoenix, Arizona. I am currently enrolled in the University of Arizona Coding Bootcanp and expected to graduate soon in July of 2021. Currently, I am employed with Empereon Constar as the Team Lead of the Frontier Communications Customer Service campaign. My daily duties currently involve assisting the supervisors in keeping track of agent numbers, managing time spent on calls, coaching and providing feedback on the agent's calls, and following the FCC Regulations when it comes to keeping Customer Proprietary Network Information secure.
                    <br />
                    I have experience working on my own on projects developing websites from the Front-End to the Back-End as well as experience working on a team remotely through Zoom, Teams, and Slack to create websites and servers from scratch. I have experience with the Front-End HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and Handlebars as well as using back-end technologies such as Node.js, Express, MySQL, and Sequelize to create databases, render HTML dynamically, and create functioning APIs. I also have learned on-the-job development methods such as AGILE development, Object-Oriented Programming, Test Driven Development, and Model-View-Controller layout. I am also adept in the MERN development stack which stands for MongoDB, Express, React.js and Node.js in creating a full-stack, single-page applications and Progressive Web Applications.</p>
