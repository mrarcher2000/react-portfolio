## Description

This webpage is my most current and up-to-date portfolio available online with my current resume, portfolio, and contact information. This project was built with Node.js and React.js and is available online at http://mrarcher2000.github.io/react-portfolio. This is a Single Page Application built with accessibility needs kept in mind and is meant to showcase just some of my abilities as a Web Developer.
